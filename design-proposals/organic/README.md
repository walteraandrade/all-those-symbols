# ORGANIC Portfolio Design

## Concept: CULTIVATED LOGIC

Logic as natural growth. Code as patient cultivation. Philosophy as ancient wisdom rooted in earth.

### Philosophy
- Ideas grow like trees - branching, interconnected, alive
- "Clarity in complexity" through organic emergence
- Software as a garden: plant, tend, harvest
- Philosophy as the soil from which code grows

### Visual Language
- **Typography**: Libre Baskerville (serif body) + Caveat (handwritten accents) + DM Sans (UI)
- **Colors**:
  - Moss green (#4A5D4A) - primary wisdom
  - Terracotta (#C67B5C) - warmth/action
  - Warm beige (#E8DFD0) - paper/parchment
  - Deep brown (#3D2F2A) - earth/text
  - Cream (#FAF7F2) - light backgrounds
  - Sage (#7D8B6A) - secondary green
- **Shapes**: Blob borders, wavy dividers, organic curves
- **Texture**: Paper grain, subtle noise, watercolor washes

### Key Elements
- Hero as growing garden scene with floating philosophy quotes
- Project cards as "specimens" with botanical illustration style
- Blog posts as journal entries on aged paper
- Navigation as winding path/vine
- Handwritten annotations and marginalia
- Subtle leaf/branch decorative elements

### Animations
- Gentle floating (like leaves in breeze)
- Breathing pulse effects
- Natural easing (ease-out-cubic)
- Slow reveals mimicking growth
- Parallax depth like forest layers

### Layout
- Asymmetric but balanced (like nature)
- Generous whitespace (breathing room)
- Overlapping organic shapes
- Text wrapped around botanical elements
- Rounded corners everywhere (16-32px)

### Philosophy Connection
- Walter's geometry love = patterns in nature
- Logic studies = taxonomy/classification
- Code architecture = tree structures
- Film analysis = deep reading of visual language
