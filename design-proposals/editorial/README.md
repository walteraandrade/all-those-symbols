# Editorial/Magazine Design Proposal

## Concept: "The Portfolio as Literary Publication"

A sophisticated editorial aesthetic inspired by high-end art and cinema magazines like Cahiers du Cinéma, Frieze, and The Paris Review. The design treats Walter's portfolio as a curated publication—each section a carefully laid-out feature article.

## Visual Language

- **Typography**: Cormorant Garamond (elegant serif headlines) + Inter (clean sans-serif body)
- **Color**: Deep charcoal (#0D0D0D) and warm cream (#FEFBF6) with vermillion (#E63946) accent
- **Layout**: Asymmetric editorial grids, generous whitespace, dramatic scale contrasts
- **Details**: Drop caps, pull quotes, elegant rules/dividers, tight headline leading

## Key Design Elements

1. **Dramatic Headlines**: Large-scale serif typography with negative tracking
2. **Multi-column Layouts**: Newspaper-inspired text flow where appropriate
3. **Pull Quotes**: Cinema essay excerpts elevated as design elements
4. **Photography-Forward**: Avatar and project images with editorial cropping
5. **Elegant Transitions**: Subtle fade-ins, smooth page transitions

## Philosophy

The design positions Walter as both engineer and essayist—someone whose cinema analyses and philosophical depth deserve the same visual treatment as a featured article in a respected literary publication. Clean, confident, intellectually rigorous.

## Technical Notes

- CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Framer Motion for subtle entrance animations
- Responsive grid that maintains editorial feel on mobile
- Print-quality typography with proper optical sizing
