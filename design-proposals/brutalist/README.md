# BRUTALIST Portfolio Design

## Concept: RAW LOGIC

Exposes the skeleton. No decoration, no polish. The markup IS the design.

### Philosophy
- Code as architecture - visible, honest, structural
- Logic professor aesthetic - blackboard chalk, typewriter manuscripts
- "Clarity in complexity" through radical transparency

### Visual Language
- **Typography**: JetBrains Mono - monospace everywhere, like terminal output
- **Colors**: Black (#000) / Off-white (#F5F5F0) / Harsh red (#FF0000)
- **Borders**: 2px solid black, visible everywhere
- **Grid**: Exposed, asymmetric, broken on purpose
- **Texture**: CRT scanline noise overlay

### Key Elements
- Giant blinking cursor on hero
- Project cards as terminal windows
- Blog posts styled as typed manuscripts with strikethrough edits
- Navigation as command-line interface
- Timestamps everywhere (like git commits)
- ASCII art decorations

### Animations
- Typewriter text reveals
- Harsh instant cuts (no ease)
- Glitch effects on hover
- Scanline scroll

### Layout Breaks
- Text running off edges
- Overlapping elements
- Vertical text for navigation
- Negative margins exposing structure
