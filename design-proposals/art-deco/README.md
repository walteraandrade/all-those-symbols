# Art Deco / Geometric Luxury Design Proposal

## Concept: "The Architect of Logic"

Walter's philosophy-meets-code identity translated through 1920s Gatsby-era opulence. Logic as architectural precision; code as master craftsmanship.

## Visual Language

- **Palette**: Deep navy (#0a0f1a) + brass/gold (#d4a574, #c9a961) + ivory accents (#f5f0e6)
- **Typography**: Poiret One (display), Josefin Sans (body) - geometric, elegant
- **Patterns**: Chevrons, sunbursts, fan shapes, stepped pyramids
- **Layout**: Strict symmetry, centered compositions, vertical rhythm

## Key Elements

1. **Sunburst hero** - Radiating gold lines from center, name in geometric display font
2. **Decorative borders** - Art deco frames around content sections
3. **Metallic gradients** - Gold-to-brass shimmer on interactive elements
4. **Fan motifs** - Section dividers using classic art deco fans
5. **Stepped typography** - Hierarchical headers with geometric flourishes

## Philosophy Connection

"Logic as architectural elegance" - The same precision that governs philosophical reasoning mirrors art deco's mathematical perfection. Every angle calculated, every proportion deliberate.

## Animation Approach

- Geometric reveals (lines draw themselves)
- Gold shimmer on hover (metallic gradient shift)
- Symmetrical fade-ins (elements enter from center outward)
- Subtle pattern pulse (background decorations breathe)
